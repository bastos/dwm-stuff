DWM RULEZ! Fact!


If you need change the dwm bar text but you dont want write bash scripts, needs a queue and some other geek stuff, use this!

What?

If you want start dwm by dwm.rb just do this:
exec ~/code/dwm-textlets/dwm.rb

But if you don't, just  use dwm.rb "textlets" to write a file, see config.rb and know how to do.
